## 🎨 Design & CSS Features

The interface is built using *modern CSS techniques* with an emphasis on responsiveness and animation.

### Responsive Design
The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using @media queries.

### CSS Animations
Various animations enhance user experience:

- @keyframes slideInFromLeft → Sliding animation for the logo on the About page  
- @keyframes growBar → Growth animation for the skill bars  

### Visual Style
- Fixed background image (background-attachment: fixed) with matching white text for readability  
- Consistent modern aesthetic across all pages  

### Skill Graph
A CSS-only bar chart created with *HTML + Flexbox*, without any external libraries.
